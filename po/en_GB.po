"Mageia IsoDumper\n"
"----------------\n"
"This GUI program is primarily for safely writing a bootable ISO image to a "
"USB flash drive, an operation devious & potentially hazardous when done by "
"hand. As a bonus, it can also back up the entire previous contents of the "
"flash drive onto the hard disc, and restore the flash drive to its previous "
"state subsequently. It gives also a feature for formatting the USB device.\n"
"\n"
"IsoDumper can be launched either from the menus, or a user or root console "
"with the command 'isodumper'. For normal users, the root password is "
"solicited; this is necessary for the program's operation. The flash drive "
"can be inserted beforehand or once the program is started. In the latter "
"case, a dialogue will say that there is no flash drive inserted, and allow a "
"'retry' to find it once it is. (You may have to close any automatically "
"opened File Manager window).\n"
"\n"
"The fields of the main window are as follows:\n"
"- Device to work on: the device of the USB flash drive, a drop-down list to "
"choose from.\n"
"- Write Image: to choose the source ISO image *.iso (or flash drive backup "
"file *.img) to write out.\n"
"- Write to device: This button launches the operation - with a prior warning "
"dialogue. If a flash drive backup was requested, this is done first. Then "
"(or only) the image file write. Each operation is shown in the progress bar "
"beneath.\n"
"- Backup in: define the name and placement of the backup image file. The "
"current flash drive will be backed up to a disc file. Note that the entire "
"flash drive is preserved, regardless of its actual contents; ensure that you "
"have the necessary free disc space (the same size as the USB device). This "
"backup file can be used later to restore the flash drive by selecting it as "
"the source *.img file to write out.\n"
"- Backup the device: launch the backup operation.\n"
"- Format the device:  create an unique partition on the entire volume in the "
"specified format in FAT, NTFS or ext. You can specify a volume name and the "
"format in a new dialog box.\n"
"- Details: this button shows detailed log information.\n"
